# ZiziBot.TelegramBot

**ZiziBot.TelegramBot** is a bot framework for helping command-based bot development. Some samples can check in **Sample** project.

This is a very early stage project, so nothing guarantee for breaking changes in the future.

This project is inspired by [VodemSharp/Allowed.Telegram.Bot](https://github.com/VodemSharp/Allowed.Telegram.Bot)
