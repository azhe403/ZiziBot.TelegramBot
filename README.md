# ZiziBot.TelegramBot 

ZiziBot.TelegramBot is a bot framework for helping command-based bot development. Some samples can check in Sample project.

This is a very early stage project, so feature still very limited. 

This project is inspired by [VodemSharp/Allowed.Telegram.Bot](https://github.com/VodemSharp/Allowed.Telegram.Bot)
